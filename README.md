# function-graph-visualizer

App for visualization of simple math functions. You can view video showcase here: [youtube](https://youtu.be/ciNEIhG0g8Q)

Here you can only find the code for the project, and no build instructions or anything. This was not a concern when I developed this project and it is not a concern now either.
